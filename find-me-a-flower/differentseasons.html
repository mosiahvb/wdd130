            <h2>Fun fact</h2>
            <p> When you go to a flower shop or a grocery store often times they give you a little packet of plant food. A lot of people will buy more plant food just to keep their plants alive and looking beautiful longer.

            <h2>Spring & Summer</h2>
            <p>Seasons will dictate the supply and demand of the variety of flowers available throughout the year. It is important to know what is in season and where these flowers are coming from. For example and the first of the spring flowers are tulips, daffodils, and hyacinth. Tulips originate from central Asia, while daffodils come from Spain and Portugal. In the summer we get roses and carnations some of the most popular flowers. An interesting fact, the majority of straight stem roses come from Ecuador. </p>
