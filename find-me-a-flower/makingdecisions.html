            <h2>Step 1!</h2>
            <p>Once you have identified the season you wish to buy flowers in, consider, what kind of event you are intending these flowers for? Is this a special occasion in which you are only interested in a small bouquet or are you in need of arrangements that are to be displayed on a table or as a centerpiece? Some examples include, if you want a formal party for a wedding you would I consider centerpieces, made of a collection of flowers in an ornate pattern. The centerpieces can be standalone or table top. If you are are celebrating a graduation or birthday party you can consider flower crowns, flower layâ€™s, or a hand held bouquet of flowers.</p>

            <h2>Step 2!</h2>
            <p>Once you've identified some of the most important attributes, it's time to put together what you've learned about different arrangements and the seasons. What season is it? The season you choose, will determine the price of the flowers you want, if you want flowers out of season, it will cost more to have those flowers. What color should the flowers be? What arrangement will work best? Perhaps you're preparing for a Mother's Day celebration, it's spring time so you have picked a wonderful table top bouquet with flowers that are currently in season filled with bright and beautiful colors. Because you knew what you we're looking for the process was made much easier than previous mothers days. Now that you know more about flowers go out and se what you can find!</p>
