      <h3>Different seasons</h3>
      <p>
        Seasons can dictate the supply and demand for what types of flowers that can be found in different arrangements. It is important to know what is in season and what is not in season to avoid spending more money that is needed. And to better your chances of getting the flowers you want. It’s also important to know that different flowers grow in different environments, some flowers grow in a certain part of the country where it is constantly warm and humid. Places like this have a consistent flow of these flowers year-round, where others only occur in a specific time. There are also events that occur during certain parts of the year, such as wedding, season, valentines, Mother’s Day, and Christmas. During these parts of the year demand is high, so it is important for you to understand what you were looking for when supplies are low. We will help you consider what season you are shopping in and what that can mean for you. Regardless of the occasion, there will always be a beautiful selection of flowers to pick from, we will do our best to help you find what you need. Different seasons will also mean different weather, different flower arrangements will last different periods of time based off of the weather in which they are kept. For example, the cold causes some flowers to shrivel up. The cold can also allow bouquets to last longer, allowing you to enjoy the beauty for long as possible.

Once you’ve identified some of the most important attributes, it’s time to put together what you’ve learned about different arrangements and the seasons. What season is it?
